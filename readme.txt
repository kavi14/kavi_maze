Please run uk.gov.dwp.maze.MazeRunner which will loaded maze file from /src/main/resources/maze1/Maze1.txt

The maze solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) method.

It takes start code (S) and looking to north initially
It go through and looking for path until it is blocked. After this, it reverse the back by looking all four directions.
This search happens until exit is found.

Printed many internal messages using sysout to see the internal execution. This is purely for information purposes only.
Log4j is not used i dont want to add more external libs added into the project.
